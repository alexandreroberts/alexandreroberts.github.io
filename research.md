My current research focuses on the history of chemistry and the alchemical tradition in Byzantium ("[Framing a Middle Byzantine Alchemical Codex][Roberts-2019-DOP-Framing]"; "A Greek Alchemical Epigram in Its Middle Byzantine Context," forthcoming) and the Islamic world, and the history of science and mathematics ("Mathematical Philology in the Treatise on Double False Position in an Arabic Manuscript at Columbia University") more broadly.
